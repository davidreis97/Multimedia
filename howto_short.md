## Music Grid

To get started, start by placing a few beats on the grid, by clicking on a few empty squares. Each grid line corresponds to an instrument, and each column corresponds to a beat. Once you press play, the website will start looping over the grid, playing the sounds as you placed them across the grid.

## Adding a new Instrument

Press the "+ New Instrument" button in the button bar below the grid. A modal will pop up, where you can provide the details of the instrument you wish to add to the grid.

We offer you a small library of instruments from which you can choose. By pressing "Toggle Library" you will be able to see all the instruments that we offer on a table. You can choose one of those instruments, or link your own audio files from anywhere on the Internet.

## Configuring MIDI Input

1. Make sure that your MIDI Input device is connected to your computer. 
2. Press the "Configure MIDI Input" button on the button bar below the music grid and "Enable MIDI Input". 
3. Choose from the dropdown list the input device that you wish to use on the website.
4. On the checkbox below, choose between a polyphonic and a monophonic synth.

## Wave

If you press the "Wave Settings" button bellow the grid, at the right of the screen, you'll see a pop up where you can change the wave speed, size, render quality and maximum sine waves.
